# facial_recognition

This is a program for facial recognition to detect , localize and as well as recognize the faces in a realtime as well as static images. Some part of the code is directly taken from Andrew Ng Convolutional Neural Network course on coursera . I have used pre-trained face-net model to implement this and the packages used are--
1. Tensorflow
2. Open- Cv
3. Imutils
